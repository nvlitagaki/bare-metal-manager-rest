# Operation Rules Guide

Operation rules define how RLA executes power control and firmware operations.
Each rule specifies a sequence of steps that determine component ordering,
parallelism, verification, and retry behavior.

## Concepts

### Rules and Operations

Each rule is bound to a single **operation** (e.g., `power_on`, `power_off`).
When an operation is triggered, RLA resolves the applicable rule for the target
rack and executes it.

### Steps and Stages

A rule contains **steps**. Each step targets one component type and belongs to
a numbered **stage**. Execution proceeds stage by stage in ascending order.
Within a stage, all steps run in parallel.

```
Stage 1: [powershelf step]
Stage 2: [nvlswitch step]
Stage 3: [compute step]        ← stages are sequential
         [nvlswitch step]      ← steps within a stage are parallel
```

### Action Sequences

Each step defines three optional action lists:

- `pre_operation` — runs before the main operation (e.g., Sleep to settle)
- `main_operation` — the primary work (PowerControl, FirmwareControl, or a
  verification action when used as the entire step's purpose)
- `post_operation` — runs after the main operation (e.g., verify status)

All three phases execute inside a single child workflow per component. The
step-level `timeout` applies to the entire sequence (pre + main + post).

## Rule Schema

### Top-level fields

Rules are submitted as JSON via the `--rule-file` flag or embedded in a YAML
batch file.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Description                        |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| `version` | string   | no       | Schema version. Defaults to `"v1"` |
| `steps`   | array    | yes      | One or more step definitions       |

### Step fields

| Field           | Type     | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `component_type`| string   | yes      | Component this step targets: `"compute"`, `"nvlswitch"`, `"powershelf"` |
| `stage`         | integer  | yes      | Execution order. Steps with the same stage run in parallel. Must be ≥ 1 |
| `max_parallel`  | integer  | yes      | Max concurrent components. `0` = unlimited, `1` = sequential |
| `timeout`       | duration | no       | Timeout for the entire child workflow (pre + main + post). E.g. `"10m"` |
| `retry`         | object   | no       | Retry policy for the child workflow |
| `pre_operation` | array    | no       | Actions to run before `main_operation` |
| `main_operation`| object   | yes      | The primary action |
| `post_operation`| array    | no       | Actions to run after `main_operation` |

### Retry policy fields

| Field                | Type    | Required | Description |
|----------------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `max_attempts`       | integer | yes      | Total attempts including the first. Must be ≥ 1 |
| `initial_interval`   | duration| yes      | Wait before first retry. E.g. `"5s"` |
| `backoff_coefficient`| float   | yes      | Multiplier for each subsequent interval. Must be ≥ 1.0 |
| `max_interval`       | duration| no       | Cap on retry interval. E.g. `"1m"` |

### Duration format

All duration fields accept Go duration strings: `"5s"`, `"30s"`, `"2m"`,
`"1m30s"`, `"10m"`, `"1h"`.

## Actions Reference

### PowerControl

Executes the power operation (on/off/restart) for the component. The operation
is inherited from the task context — no parameters required.

```json
{ "name": "PowerControl" }
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | no       | Overrides step timeout for this action only |

---

### FirmwareControl

Executes the firmware operation (upgrade/downgrade) for the component.

```json
{ "name": "FirmwareControl" }
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | no       | Overrides step timeout for this action only |

---

### VerifyPowerStatus

Polls the component until its power status matches `expected_status`. Typically
used in `post_operation` to confirm the result of `PowerControl`.

```json
{
  "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
  "timeout": "30s",
  "poll_interval": "5s",
  "parameters": {
    "expected_status": "on"
  }
}
```

| Field           | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout`       | yes      | Maximum time to wait for status to match |
| `poll_interval` | yes      | How often to check status |
| `expected_status` (param) | yes | `"on"` or `"off"` |

When used as `main_operation`, the step performs only verification (no power
command is sent). This is the pattern for forceful operation final-verification
stages.

---

### VerifyReachability

Polls until all components of the specified types in the rack become reachable
over the network. Used after powering on a powershelf to confirm downstream
components have booted.

```json
{
  "name": "VerifyReachability",
  "timeout": "3m",
  "poll_interval": "10s",
  "parameters": {
    "component_types": ["compute", "nvlswitch"]
  }
}
```

| Field              | Required | Description |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout`          | yes      | Maximum time to wait |
| `poll_interval`    | yes      | How often to probe |
| `component_types` (param) | yes | Array of component type strings to check |

---

### Sleep

Pauses execution for a fixed duration. Implemented as a durable workflow timer
(survives worker restarts). Useful for hardware settle time.

```json
{
  "name": "Sleep",
  "parameters": {
    "duration": "30s"
  }
}
```

| Field        | Required | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `duration` (param) | yes | How long to sleep. E.g. `"30s"`, `"2m"` |

---

### GetPowerStatus

Queries the current power status of components and returns a status map.

```json
{
  "name": "GetPowerStatus",
  "timeout": "30s"
}
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | yes      | Maximum time for the query |

---

## Examples

### Graceful power on

Powers components in dependency order (powershelf → nvlswitch → compute) and
verifies status at each stage before proceeding.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 1,
      "max_parallel": 1,
      "timeout": "10m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0,
        "max_interval": "1m"
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        },
        {
          "name": "VerifyReachability",
          "timeout": "3m",
          "poll_interval": "10s",
          "parameters": { "component_types": ["compute", "nvlswitch"] }
        },
        {
          "name": "Sleep",
          "parameters": { "duration": "30s" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "nvlswitch",
      "stage": 2,
      "max_parallel": 4,
      "timeout": "15m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0,
        "max_interval": "1m"
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "compute",
      "stage": 3,
      "max_parallel": 8,
      "timeout": "20m",
      "retry": {

          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Graceful power off

Reverse dependency order (compute → nvlswitch → powershelf). A `Sleep` in the
powershelf `pre_operation` allows downstream components to finish shutting down
before cutting power.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "compute",
      "stage": 1,
      "max_parallel": 8,
      "timeout": "20m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "nvlswitch",
      "stage": 2,
      "max_parallel": 4,
      "timeout": "15m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 3,
      "max_parallel": 1,
      "timeout": "10m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "pre_operation": [
        {
          "name": "Sleep",
          "parameters": { "duration": "30s" }
        }
      ],
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Forceful power on

Skips per-stage verification for maximum speed. All power commands are issued
first; a dedicated final stage (4) verifies all component types simultaneously.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 1,

## Temporal Execution Model

This section describes what actually happens inside the Temporal executor when
a rule is applied to a task.

### 1. Rule resolution

Before any workflow starts, the task manager resolves the applicable rule for
the operation and rack using this priority order:

```
1. Rack-specific association  (rack_rule_associations table for this rack)
2. Global default rule        (is_default = true for this operation)
3. Hardcoded fallback         (built into the binary)
```

The resolved `RuleDefinition` is embedded in the `ExecutionInfo` passed to the
parent workflow. The workflow never queries the database.

### 2. Parent workflow — sequential stages

`PowerControl` (or `FirmwareControl`) is the parent Temporal workflow. It does
pure orchestration:

```
for each stage in ascending stage number:
    executeGenericStageParallel(stage.steps)   ← waits before advancing
```

If any stage fails, the workflow stops and the task is marked failed. Stages do
not roll back.

The parent workflow has no retry policy of its own (`MaxAttempts = 1`). Retries
are configured at the child workflow (step) level.

The parent workflow's execution timeout is auto-calculated from the sum of each
stage's maximum step timeout, plus a 10 % overhead buffer. You do not set it
directly.

### 3. Stage execution — parallel child workflows

Within a stage, each step spawns one `GenericComponentStepWorkflow` child
workflow. All child workflows in the stage are launched simultaneously and the
parent waits for all of them to finish before advancing.

```
Stage N:
  ┌─────────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │ child: powershelf step  │  │ child: nvlswitch step   │  ← in parallel
  └─────────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────────┘
           both must complete before Stage N+1 begins
```

Steps whose component type is not present in the rack are silently skipped.

The child workflow's `WorkflowExecutionTimeout` is set to the step's `timeout`
field (defaulting to 30 minutes if unset). This timeout covers the entire
pre + main + post sequence.

### 4. Child workflow — action sequence

`GenericComponentStepWorkflow` runs the three action phases in order:

```
pre_operation actions  (sequential)
       ↓
main_operation action
       ↓
post_operation actions (sequential)
```

The step's `retry` policy applies to the **entire child workflow**. If any
action fails and retries are exhausted, the child workflow fails, which fails
the stage, which fails the parent workflow.

Activity options (timeout, retry) for individual Temporal activities are derived
from the step configuration via `buildActivityOptions`. If the step has no
`retry` block, a default of 3 attempts with 1 s initial interval and 2× backoff
is used.

### 5. Action dispatch

Each action name is looked up in a registry that maps it to an executor
function:

| Action | Executor | Temporal primitive |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| `Sleep` | `executeSleepAction` | `workflow.Sleep()` — durable timer |
| `PowerControl` | `executePowerControlAction` | `workflow.ExecuteActivity("PowerControl")` |
| `FirmwareControl` | `executeFirmwareControlAction` | `workflow.ExecuteActivity("FirmwareControl")` |
| `GetPowerStatus` | `executeGetPowerStatusAction` | `workflow.ExecuteActivity("GetPowerStatus")` |
| `VerifyPowerStatus` | `executeVerifyPowerStatusAction` | polling loop (see below) |
| `VerifyReachability` | `executeVerifyReachabilityAction` | polling loop (see below) |

`Sleep` is a workflow timer, not an activity. It survives worker restarts and
does not consume an activity slot.

### 6. Polling actions

`VerifyPowerStatus` and `VerifyReachability` are implemented as workflow-level
polling loops — not as single activities. Each iteration calls
`GetPowerStatus` (a Temporal activity) and then `workflow.Sleep` for
`poll_interval` before trying again. The loop exits when the condition is
satisfied or `timeout` is exceeded.

```
loop:
    call GetPowerStatus activity
    if condition met → return success
    if elapsed > timeout → return error
    workflow.Sleep(poll_interval)
```

Because the sleep inside the loop is a durable workflow timer, the worker can
restart mid-poll without losing progress.

`VerifyReachability` uses the same pattern but checks multiple component types,
remembering which types have already become reachable across iterations.

### 7. Cross-component verification

`VerifyReachability` needs to check component types other than the one the
current step targets (e.g., a powershelf step checking whether compute and
nvlswitch are reachable). The parent workflow passes the full
`map[ComponentType]Target` to every child workflow, which in turn passes it to
every action executor. `VerifyReachability` uses this map to probe the correct
targets regardless of the step's own component type.
